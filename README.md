# PandemicAnalysis_FinalProject

Final group project in which the COVID-19 data were analyzed and trends were visualized using Python, Pandas, Machine Learning, Plotly, JavaScript, D3, Tableau and HTML/CSS. We examined the amount of cases and deaths that have been reported for every country, as well as compared the amount of cases per state within the United States. Moreover, we compared the gender demographics and death rates for people infected with this virus.

## Machine Learning Models:

Four models were created using supervised machine learning to analyze the relationship between the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths/recovered cases for all countries, as well as the relationship between deaths and gender. Using linear regression and calculating the R-squared score, the relationship between these values was determined.

## Gender Comparison Using D3:

D3 graph for gender

A scatterplot was created within the app.js file using JavaScript and D3. The data was pulled from the data.csv file and the d3.select() function was used to append the graph into the HTML file. CSS was used for both the HTML page styling and the scatterplot styling. D3 was used for animations, transitions, click events on the x and y labels, and tooltips when the cursor hovers over the state circles.

## Map of Cases in the U.S. Using JavaScript:

 state and county

n this assignment, an HTML page containing a dynamic table that displays UFO data was created. The table can be filtered by different criteria, and was created using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and D3.

## Tracker and live Update: 

Visualization of cases around the world using a map. Tracks the number of cases, deaths, recovered cases, new cases and new deaths for every country using an API.
